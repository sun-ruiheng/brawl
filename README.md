Hello! This is my first project by HTML and CSS. It will be a very basic website, themed by the game Brawl Stars. 
I hope to add different tabs and pages that include images, videos, and maybe interactive elements.
This is made with Visual Studio Code, and I might add JavaScript code later on to improve interactivity.
I'm still trying to figure GitHub out.

hello again, I typed this on VSCode!
